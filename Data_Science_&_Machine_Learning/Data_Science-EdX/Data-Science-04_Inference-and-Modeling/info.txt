Abstract
This is the fourth in a series of courses in a Professional Certificate in Data Science program, a series of courses that prepare you to do data analysis in R, from simple computations to machine learning. Statistical inference and modeling are indispensable for analyzing data affected by chance, and thus essential for data scientists. In this course, you will learn these key concepts through a motivating case study on election forecasting.

This course will show you how inference and modeling can be applied to develop the statistical approaches that make polls an effective tool and we’ll show you how to do this using R. You will learn concepts necessary to define estimates and margins of errors and learn how you can use these to make predictions relatively well and also provide an estimate of the precision of your forecast.

Once you learn this you will be able to understand two concepts that are ubiquitous in data science: confidence intervals and p-values.

Finally, to understand statements about the probability of a candidate winning, you will learn about Bayesian modeling. At the end of the course, we will put it all together to recreate a simplified version of an election forecast model and apply it to the 2016 US presidential election.

The textbook for the Data Science course series is freely available online.

Learning Objectives
The concepts necessary to define estimates and margins of errors of populations, parameters, estimates, and standard errors in order to make predictions about data
How to use models to aggregate data from different sources
The very basics of Bayesian statistics and predictive modeling
Course Overview
Section 1: Parameters and Estimates
You will learn how to estimate population parameters.

Section 2: The Central Limit Theorem in Practice
You will apply the central limit theorem to assess how close a sample estimate is to the population parameter of interest.

Section 3: Confidence Intervals and p-Values
You will learn how to calculate confidence intervals and learn about the relationship between confidence intervals and p-values.

Section 4: Statistical Models
You will learn about statistical models in the context of election forecasting.

Section 5: Bayesian Statistics
You will learn about Bayesian statistics through looking at examples from rare disease diagnosis and baseball.

Section 6: Election Forecasting
You will learn about election forecasting, building on what you’ve learned in the previous sections about statistical modeling and Bayesian statistics.

Section 7: Association Tests
You will learn how to use association and chi-squared tests to perform inference for binary, categorical, and ordinal data through an example looking at research funding rates.
